# PC-Project-2
UW Coding Bootcamp Project #2 

Introduction: 
This project is our Second group project at university of Washington bootcamp. The team members are Craig Compton and Pushpinder Kaur Brar. This our first full stack project and the languages and technologies we will be using will be HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Node Express, MySQL, SQL, ORM, CRUD, MVC, moment.js etc. 
The Idea for this project came from our daily needs of someone reminding us to complete our tasks. Users can make a list of a tasks for the day and ask our application to remind them throughout the day. Users have an option to choose between a reminder tune, silent pop up or a text to speak voice. 
	

General Idea:
The general idea behind this application is to provide the users an application which is easy to use and more interactive than usual reminder applications. The main focus of this application is to let users add all of their tasks for the day and let the app remind users on the chosen time. Users will also have an option to look for the past reminders and also add reminders for the future. 


Target Audience:
The target audience is all the users of any age. Although this is going to help more the working busy people but we also feel our app will be very helpful for elderly people to remind about their tasks, one example can be to remind them to take their medicine. 

Problem that the product will address:
This product is going to address the problem of complexity of apps already exist in the market. Usually the apps save all the reminders at the same page, for example all the past, present and future reminders are at the same page, if a user has 10 reminders for a present day and 10 of past or future, they are all at the same page which is hard for users to track. 
Our app is going to provide users a better way to plan their day and future on separate pages. The user can also easily focus on the present day and schedule the whole day with reminders while also getting some pre-reminders of the future to-dos. 
Another Interesting thing about this app is that it is going to read the users their reminders.  For example, “Please drink water”, “Don’t forget to take 5 minutes break”, “Call Anna” etc.
 

Primary goal of the product:
The primary goal of this project is to help the users make their daily schedule or to do list and remind them the tasks they need to do.
